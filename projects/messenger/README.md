This program passes messages between the various connected chains. 
It has a config (xdapp.config.json) that you'll usually find in xDapp Projects which outlines the RPC endpionts for various networks.
It also has a messenger.js, the main orchestration file that is in charge of carrying out the various tasks for each of the networks, like deploying code and interacting with contracts.
